# RanTodd Website (Legacy)

# Note

This website was designed for older versions of the bot (RanTodd era) and will likely not work as intended. It's also a lot heavier and we don't recommend using it in general.

This is the website (including leaderboard) for the RanTodd Discord bot. It's built using Gatsby.
